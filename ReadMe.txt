About:
Tellus Heightmap Generator is program that generates random heightmaps
based on given variables and allows users to export them either as a
Targa texture or as an OBJ mesh file. The randomness of the heightmap
is done through 2D Perlin noise using the number of octaves and the
amount of persistence the user inputs. The user can also change the
level of detail, or LOD, of the mesh as well as the difference in height
between the highest and lowest points. Tellus was written in C++ and GLSL
and was completed over a 2.5 month period.
